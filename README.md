# How to make a new branch
First create the branch w/ this command: git branch branch-name

Then check out the branch with: git checkout branch-name

Then to add and commit changes to your branch use: git add/commit/push w/ name of file

Use git status to check on your branch and see what branch you are on

Then to get onto the master you better make a pull request fool.
